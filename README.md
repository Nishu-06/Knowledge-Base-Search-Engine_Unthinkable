# Knowledge-Base Q&A (RAG powered)

An **AI-powered Knowledge Base Search Engine** that allows you to upload multiple documents, search across them, and get **synthesized answers** with citations using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  

Built with **React + Node.js + Google Gemini**

## 💡 Why this project?
This project was built as part of my assignment for **Unthinkable Solutions**.  
My goal was to explore **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**, and show how  
traditional search + LLMs can be combined for powerful knowledge systems.
